// Question: What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

// Answer: An argument is what you pass to a function (in the parentheses) when you invoke it.
// A parameter is a variable that is the placeholder for the argument (that is provided when the
// function is invoked) while you are defining the function.  So you use parameters
// when you define a function and you use arguments when you invoke the function.

// Question: Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?

// Answer: A return will stop the execution of the function.  A console.log within
// a function does not stop the execution and the value within the console.log is
// printed in the console but it does not go/is not saved anywhere else.  When you
// use return you make the function return a value that can be used in other processes, functions, etc.
