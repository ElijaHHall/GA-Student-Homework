Part 1 - Github
1. git init
2. git add file_name.file_extension
3. git commit -m 'commit message'

1. git pull origin master
2. git reset file_name.file_extension
3. git checkout -- file_name.file_extension
4. Because it specifies to git that you are checking out a file rather than an entire branch
5. If you made a commit that you later regretted it would be nice to revert back to a previous commit.
